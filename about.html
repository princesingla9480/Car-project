The Auto Expo was conceived in the year 1985 and had its debut showcasing in 1986.[1] The Auto Expo 1986 was a window for technology transfers showing how the Indian Automotive Industry was absorbing new technologies and promoting indigenous research and development for adapting these technologies for the rugged Indian conditions. The 9 day show was marked by then Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi.[1]
